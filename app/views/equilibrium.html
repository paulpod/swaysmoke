  <h2 id="tagline" class="heading-large">Cutting through biased mainstream media </h2>


  <!--<h3 class="subhead">What is it?</h3>-->

  <h3 class="heading-medium">The Equilibrium Platform</h3>

  <p>The media landscape today is littered with extreme political views that rarely describe a balanced view on important issues. </p>

  <p>Add to this a society plagued with a â€œperennial time-scarcity problem," and it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to get balanced point of view on today's issues. </p>

  <p>That's why we created - Equilibrium - a news service that curates every side of the argument so you can cut through the biased agendas and get to the heart of the issue, at speed! </p>





  <h3 class="heading-medium">How it works</h3>

  <p>We take the key issues, debates and questions gripping society everyday and organise the media landscape from left to right.</p>

  <p>All national publications are included, so we retain no bias. The platform is highly curated with each issue, debate or question containing three layers to explore:</p>

  <p>An example of how the platform works:</p>

  <p><strong>Example Question:</strong> In last night's debate with Paxman who came out on top: Teressa May or Jeremy Corbyn?

  <h3 class="heading-medium">About us</h3>

  <p>We believe a prosperous society is built on sharing knowledge. </p>

  <p>Only if we make available, to all members of the society news and opinion that can be used to improve the human condition, will we prosper together.</p>

  <p>Today a fundamental source of knowledge in society - the mainstream media - is failing the people. </p>

  <p><strong>We hope to reverse this trend with Equilibrium.</strong></p>
